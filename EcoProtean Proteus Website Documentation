 EcoProtean Proteus Website Documentation

1. Project Overview

Purpose
The EcoProtean Proteus system consists of two components:

- Website (Community Platform): Provides users with ecological information on seedling planting for landslide prevention and enables community interaction through comments and reactions.
- Interactive Comment and Reaction System: Allows users to discuss ecological initiatives, recommend seedlings, and engage with the content through like, dislike, and heart reactions.

Key Features
- Community Platform:
  - Post comments related to ecological initiatives.
  - React to posts with like, dislike, or heart reactions.
  - Limit one reaction per user per post.
  
- Seedling Recommendations:
  - Display detailed information about seedlings recommended for ecological purposes.
  - Discuss and share experiences related to environmental conservation.

10. Future Enhancements

- Backend Integration: Migrate from JavaScript-based local storage to a full backend for real-time users interaction handling.
- User Authentication: Introduce user login to manage individual accounts for personalized interactions.
- Seedling Database: Expand the website to provide a database of seedlings with filtering options for users to find the best planting recommendations for specific areas.
- Analytics: Provide insights on community engagement, such as most-reacted-to comments and frequently asked seedling-related questions.

Conclusion

EcoProtean Proteus is an interactive platform designed to engage users with ecological initiatives and foster community-driven conversations about seedlings for environmental conservation.It is a website where users can see suggestions what seedlings have strong roots density to plant in the places in manolo where is landslides are often happen. The website balances a clean, user-friendly interface with functional features such as comments and reactions, aiming to empower individuals and communities to take action in protecting the environment. Future enhancements will focus on scalability, user personalization, and data-driven recommendations.
